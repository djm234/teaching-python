    "Computers are essentially dumb machines that do not do anything by themselves. They need to be told what to do, and programming languages are how humans can do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a fantastic language for a beginner to start programming in - there are no confusing symbols that can make things seem scarily complicated, and the way code is written makes it relatively easy to read. In a short space of time you can learn to do some really interesting stuff, or even understand someone else's code that has had years more experience than you! If you can't work out how to do something, the answer is always a Google away :)\n",
    "\n",
    "This document is called a 'notebook'. It is like an interactive web page where you can write Python code into a 'cell' and see the output on the screen. Once code is written in a cell, it can be 'run' by pressing `Ctrl`+`Enter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this document, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Make Python print a message on the screen.\n",
    "- Perform some basic maths calculations.\n",
    "- Create a shopping list.\n",
    "- Use a 'dictionary' and a 'loop' to find out the cost of your shopping list.\n",

    "## Hello, world!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's jump straight in, and create our first Python command - we will get Python to say \"Hello, world!\" for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this we need to use a `print` function, which 'prints' to screen. Functions in Python accept arguments, which are passed inside curved braces `()`. In the case of the `print` function, it expects a type of data referred to as a string - textual data. So let's pass the `print` function our \"Hello, world\" string and then run it (`Ctrl`+`Enter`)."
