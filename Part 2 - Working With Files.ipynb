    "# Part 2 - Working with Files\n",
    "This section will introduce how to use Python to open files and work with the data inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Python's `open` function\n",
    "Opening files makes use of the `open` function, which can read or write to files. Once files are opened and finished with, they need closing so that we keep things 'clean'. Usually this might take the form:\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_file_object = open('path/to/file.txt', 'r')  # The 'r' signifies that we want to read the file.\n",
    "lines = my_file_object.readlines()\n",
    "my_file_object.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "In order to keep things clean as mentioned before, we will use a `with` statement to create the file object. Below that statement is nested code - once those tasks are complete and the program moves out of the indent, the file is automatically closed. This makes things easier to read also.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use this to open the 'spreadsheet.csv'. This contains the following data in a comma-separated format, which if opened in Excel would show a spreadsheet like:\n",
    "\n",
    "| item | price | quantity |\n",
    "|------|-------|----------|\n",
    "|beans|0.95|1|\n",
    "|mushroom|0.1|10|\n",

    "Yes! There is a much easier way to work with file data, where the format is a more common type. For example; a CSV file, Zip file, HTML, and many more than can be reasonably listed here. Often it is the case someone (or  agroup of people in the Open Source Community) have written a Python package to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once of the most useful packages for working with data in spreadsheet-like files is the `pandas` module/package. This is covered next.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing packages like `pandas` is made easy using the command line, via commands like `pip install pandas`. An explanation how to install packages using e.g. `pip` is covered elsewhere. Once installed, modules can be imported into code by e.g. typing `import pandas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the `pandas` module to open files\n",
    "The `pandas` module contains many functions to work with data in a table structure - perfect for anyone who has reached the limits of Excel and want to do something more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept is fairly simple - you open a file using Pandas, then you can access or transform the data in the table/spreadsheet row-, column-, or cell-wise. You can also add to or delete the data in this way, and then re-write the table to a file in a different format."
